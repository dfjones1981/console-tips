# Eager Evaluation

A quick quality of life improvement. Enabling eager evaluation will show the result of your expression before it's executed.

To enable Eager Evaluation:

- Open the Console.
- Open Console Settings (settings cog in top left)
- Enable the Eager evaluation checkbox.

DevTools does not eager evaluate if the expression causes side effects

<Playground>
  <Button
    onClick={() => {
      console.log("I was clicked!");
    }}
  >
    Evaluate Me (Eagerly)!
  </Button>
</Playground>
