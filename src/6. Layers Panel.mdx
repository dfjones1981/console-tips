# Snippets

Snippets are user defined javascript files that are stored and persisted within Chrome Dev Tools and can be executed against any page.

Useful for automatic repetitive tasks, exatracting values for feedback or just breaking things.

Snippets are found in a subtab on the Sources tab.

Visit https://bgrins.github.io/devtools-snippets/ for a list of user submitted snippets.
