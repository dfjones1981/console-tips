# Sensors Panel

You can override most of the sensors Chrome has access to, including Location.

Useful for testing location aware apps that have specific functionality when the user is at a specfic location.

<Playground>
  <Button
    onClick={() => {
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(pos => {
        alert(pos.coords.latitude + ", " + pos.coords.longitude);
      });
    }}
  >
    Where am I?
  </Button>
</Playground>
