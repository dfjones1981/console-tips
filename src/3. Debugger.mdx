# Debugger

```javascript
// do some work
debugger;
// do some more work
```

Adding the debugger statement anywhere in your javascript code will cause the debugger to open when the statement is executed.
Useful for pausing execution at a specific point with out having to find the line and attach a breakpoint

<Playground>
  <Button
    onClick={() => {
      let x = 10;
      debugger;
      console.log(x);
    }}
  >
    Debug Me!
  </Button>
</Playground>
